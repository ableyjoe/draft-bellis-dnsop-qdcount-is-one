1.  Introduction

   An oft-repeated claim is that the DNS protocol [RFC1034][RFC1035]
   theoreticaly permits a DNS query to contain more than one question.

   While this claim might initially appear valid (the QDCOUNT field is a
   16-bit field with a range of 0 .. 65535) in practise there are other
   limitations inherent in the protocol that make use of a QDCOUNT
   greater than one impractical.  In particular there are no defined
   semantics for how to handle those response fields that might vary for
   different QNAMEs (e.g.  AA bit, RCODE).

   In this document we normatively clarify the currently legal values of
   the QDCOUNT field, especially when applied to the Query OpCode.

2.  Terminology used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  QDCOUNT is (almost always) one

   [RFC1035] significantly predates the use of normative requirements
   keywords, and parts of it are therefore somewhat open to
   interpretation.

Internet-Draft        DNS QDCOUNT is (usually) ONE         February 2023


   Section 4.1.2 ("Question section format") has this to say about
   QDCOUNT:

      The section contains QDCOUNT (usually 1) entries

   However, the only documented exceptions within [RFC1035] relate to
   the IQuery Opcode, where the request has "an empty question section"
   (QDCOUNT == 0), and "zero, one, or multiple domain names for the
   specified resource as QNAMEs in the question section".

   The IQuery OpCode was formally obsoleted in [RFC3425].

   In the absence of clearly expressed normative requirements, we rely
   on other text in [RFC1035] that makes use of the definite article or
   other text that implies a singuar question, and therefore QDCOUNT ==
   1.

   For example, Section 4.1:

      the question for the name server

   and:

      The question section contains fields that describe a question to a
      name server

   and in Section 4.1.1.  ("Header section format"):

      AA Authoritative Answer - this bit is valid in responses, and
      specifies that the responding name server is an authority for the
      domain name in question section.

3.1.  Exceptions

   There is one exception to QDCOUNT == 1.

   DNS Cookies [RFC7873] in Section 5.4 allow a client to receive a
   valid Server Cookie without sending a specific question by sending a
   Query packet (OpCode 0) with QDCOUNT == 0, with the resulting
   response also containing no question.

4.  Other DNS Opcodes

4.1.  DNS Notify

   DNS Notify [RFC1996] also lacks a clearly defined range of values for
   QDCOUNT.  Section 3.7 says:

Internet-Draft        DNS QDCOUNT is (usually) ONE         February 2023


      A NOTIFY request has QDCOUNT > 0

   but all other text in the RFC talks about the <QNAME, QCLASS, QTYPE>
   tuple in the singular.

4.2.  DNS Update

   DNS Update [RFC2136] renames the QDCOUNT field to ZOCOUNT, but the
   value is constrained to be one by Section 2.3 ("Zone Section"):

      All records to be updated must be in the same zone, and therefore
      the Zone Section is allowed to contain exactly one record.

4.3.  DNS Stateful Operations

   DNS Stateful Operations [RFC8490] (DSO - OpCode 6) attempts to
   preserve compatibility with the standard DNS 12 octet header, and
   does so by requiring that all four of the section count values be set
   to zero.

5.  Conclusion

   The only legal values of the 16-bit word contained in octets 4 and 5
   of the DNS header (usually called QDCOUNT) are zero (rarely) and one,
   otherwise.

   Future OpCodes may define other uses and legal values for the header
   octets used by this field.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security implications.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA considerations.
